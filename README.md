What is CPU

SEND

Bot:
CPU stands for Central Processing Unit, which is the primary component of a computer that performs most of the data processing and executes instructions from software programs.

The CPU is responsible for:

1. Executing instructions: The CPU reads and interprets instructions from software programs, such as operating systems, applications, and games.
2. Performing calculations: The CPU performs arithmetic and logical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, to process data.
3. Managing memory: The CPU manages the computer's memory (RAM) by allocating space for running programs and storing data.
4. Controlling input/output operations: The CPU handles input/output operations, such as reading from or writing to storage devices like hard drives, solid-state drives, or flash drives.

In simple terms, the CPU is the "brain" of your computer, responsible for executing instructions, performing calculations, and managing memory and I/O operations.
