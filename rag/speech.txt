Speech on India’s Weather and Seasons

Good morning everyone,

Today I am going to talk about the weather and seasons of India.

India is a vast country, and because of its size and geography, we enjoy different types of weather throughout the year. Broadly, India has four main seasons – summer, monsoon, autumn, and winter.

In summer (March to June), the weather is hot, especially in the north, where temperatures can cross 40 degrees. Many people travel to hill stations during this time to escape the heat.

In the monsoon (June to September), the southwest winds bring rain to most of India. Farmers depend on this rain for their crops, but sometimes too much rain causes floods.

In autumn (October to November), the weather becomes pleasant. The skies are clear, and this is the season of festivals like Diwali and Durga Puja.

In winter (December to February), the north experiences very cold weather, with snowfall in the mountains, while the south enjoys mild and comfortable winters.

Each season in India has its own beauty and importance. Together, they make our country’s weather unique and wonderful.

Thank you.
